SESSION PROMPTS — Copy-paste these at the start of each Claude Code session
==============================================================================


--- PROMPT 1: BUG FIX ---
Bugs
Read the following documentation files to understand the project:
- CLAUDE.md (root)
- docs/BACKEND_APPS.md
- docs/API_ENDPOINTS.md
- docs/API_RESPONSES.md
- docs/FRONTEND_PAGES.md
- docs/FRONTEND_COMPONENTS.md
- docs/ATTENDANCE_PIPELINE.md
- docs/ENV_AND_DEPLOYMENT.md

Now, here are the issue:
1- https://kodereduai.onrender.com/academics/promotion at the end of wizard where students shows are not in roll number order
2- on same page AI advisor starts and shows Tasks in background but stuck at zero on Render production env
3- https://kodereduai.onrender.com/academics/marks-entry on this page subject filter not showing data

Based on the documentation:
1. Identify which apps, models, serializers, API endpoints, and frontend
   pages/components are involved
2. Trace the data flow from frontend to backend for this feature
3. Propose a step-by-step plan to fix the issue
4. After implementing the fix, update the relevant docs/ files if any API
   responses, endpoints, models, or component behavior changed


--- PROMPT 2: NEW FEATURE ---

Read all docs/ files for project context.

I want to add [feature description — e.g., "SMS notifications when a
student is marked absent"].

1. Identify all related modules, endpoints, and components from the docs
2. Plan the implementation (backend models/views, frontend pages, API changes)
3. Implement it
4. Update docs/ files to reflect any new endpoints, response fields,
   components, or model changes


--- PROMPT 3: DEBUGGING ---

Read all docs/ files for project context.

Bug: [description — e.g., "POST /api/attendance/uploads/{id}/confirm/
returns 500 when academic_year is null"]

1. Use API_ENDPOINTS.md and API_RESPONSES.md to understand the expected
   behavior
2. Trace the issue through backend code
3. Fix it
4. Update API_RESPONSES.md or API_ENDPOINTS.md if the fix changes any
   API behavior


--- PROMPT 4: REFACTORING / IMPROVEMENT ---

Read all docs/ files for project context.

I want to refactor/improve [description — e.g., "the attendance pipeline
to support batch uploads of multiple images at once"].

1. Read ATTENDANCE_PIPELINE.md (or relevant doc) to understand current flow
2. Identify all affected files: models, views, serializers, frontend components
3. Propose a plan with minimal disruption to existing functionality
4. Implement the changes
5. Update all affected docs/ files (especially API_ENDPOINTS.md,
   API_RESPONSES.md, and the relevant pipeline/component docs)


--- PROMPT 5: FRONTEND-ONLY CHANGE ---

Read these docs for context:
- CLAUDE.md
- docs/FRONTEND_PAGES.md
- docs/FRONTEND_COMPONENTS.md
- docs/API_RESPONSES.md

Task: [description — e.g., "Add a filter by date range on the attendance
register page"]

1. Identify the page component and its sub-components from FRONTEND_PAGES.md
2. Check API_RESPONSES.md for available query params on the related endpoint
3. Implement the frontend change
4. Update FRONTEND_PAGES.md or FRONTEND_COMPONENTS.md if new components
   or props were added


--- PROMPT 6: BACKEND-ONLY CHANGE ---

Read these docs for context:
- CLAUDE.md
- docs/BACKEND_APPS.md
- docs/API_ENDPOINTS.md
- docs/API_RESPONSES.md

Task: [description — e.g., "Add a bulk delete endpoint for expired
fee payments"]

1. Identify the relevant app, models, and existing endpoints from the docs
2. Implement the new endpoint (view, serializer, URL registration)
3. Update API_ENDPOINTS.md with the new endpoint
4. Update API_RESPONSES.md with the sample response
5. Update BACKEND_APPS.md if any model changes were made


--- PROMPT 7: QUICK INVESTIGATION ---

Read all docs/ files for project context.

I need to understand: [question — e.g., "How does the session-scoped
roll number system work? Why is roll_number on both Student and
StudentEnrollment?"]

1. Search the docs for all references to the topic
2. Trace through the relevant code (models, views, frontend)
3. Explain the current implementation clearly
4. Suggest improvements if any issues are found
