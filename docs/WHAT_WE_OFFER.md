## What We Offer

KoderEduAI is a **complete, AI-powered School ERP** that replaces 10+ disconnected tools with one intelligent platform — built for the way schools actually work.

**Attendance That Thinks for You** — Snap a photo of your handwritten attendance register, and our AI reads it, matches students, and digitizes records in seconds. No biometric hardware. No QR codes. No behavior change. Just your existing registers + a camera.

**Face Recognition Attendance** — For schools ready to go fully digital: students walk in, the camera identifies them, attendance is marked. Done.

**Every Module. One Platform.**

| Academics | Operations | Finance | People |
|-----------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Timetable & Scheduling | Transport & GPS Tracking | Fee Collection & Online Payments | HR, Payroll & Leave |
| Exams, Marks & Report Cards | Library Management | Discounts & Scholarships | Staff Appraisals |
| Lesson Plans & Assignments | Hostel & Gate Passes | Expense Tracking & Budgeting | Parent & Student Portals |
| AI Study Helper for Students | Inventory & Stock | Financial Reports (PDF/Excel) | Multi-Channel Notifications |
| Academic Year & Promotions | Admissions CRM | JazzCash & EasyPaisa Integration | Role-Based Access (9 Roles) |

**Built for School Chains** — Run 1 school or 100 from one dashboard. Each branch gets its own data, its own branding, its own modules — centrally managed by you.

## How We're Different

| The Old Way (Everyone Else) | The KoderEduAI Way |
|---|---|
| Need biometric machines, RFID cards, or QR scanners for digital attendance | **Just photograph your existing register** — AI does the rest |
| Buy a monolithic suite, pay for 50 modules, use 5 | **Enable only the modules you need** — pay for what you use |
| Separate apps for attendance, fees, HR, LMS, transport | **One platform, every function** — no integrations to break |
| "AI-powered" means a chatbot that answers FAQs | **Real AI**: OCR + LLM reasoning + face recognition + AI study helper + AI financial queries |
| Built on legacy PHP/jQuery from 2012 | **Modern stack**: React + Django REST + Celery async — fast, secure, scalable |
| Each school branch = separate login, separate database | **True multi-tenancy**: switch between branches in one click |
| Parent portal = one-way notification dump | **Two-way engagement**: messaging, leave requests, live fee status, exam results |
| Attendance corrections disappear | **Self-learning AI**: every correction you make teaches the system — accuracy improves over time |

## Why Schools Are Switching

**Zero Hardware Investment** — Your teachers already have phones. Our AI attendance works with a simple photo. No CapEx. No installation. No maintenance contracts.

**From Paper to Digital in One Day** — Schools don't need to change their existing attendance workflow. Photograph the register you already maintain — we digitize it automatically.

**18 Modules, One Price** — Attendance, Finance, HR, Academics, Exams, Transport, Library, Hostel, Inventory, Admissions, LMS, Notifications, Parent Portal, Student Portal, Reports, and more. No hidden module add-on fees.

**AI That Actually Works** — Not a marketing buzzword. Our pipeline uses Google Cloud Vision for OCR, Groq LLM for intelligent matching, and dlib for face recognition — with a human-in-the-loop review system that gets smarter with every use.

**Built for Scale** — Whether you run a single 200-student school or a chain of 50 branches, the architecture handles it natively. Async task processing means no lag, even during peak admission season.
